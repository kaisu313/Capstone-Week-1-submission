        "After months of searching, he has narrowed down to downtown vancouver South West vs North East area.  Both areas have similar demographics so now it is up to which area will have less competition in that space.  The target audience of his store will be general public living and working in downtown vancouver.  It is important that this business thrives as it is his first flagship shop in Canada.  Future prospects for further expansion will hinge on whether the store is successful.\n",
