        "1) Vancouver BC's location coordinates through GEONAMES\n",
        " https://www.geonames.org/postal-codes/CA/BC/british-columbia.html\n",

        " We will scrub this page and put the relevant datatable into a dataframe\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 2)  FourSquare to explore the most common venues in each area\n",
        "\n",
        " We will extract the venues in each area through calling FourSquare's API.  Then we will explore their popularity by ranking them.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 3)  We will compare locate South West downtown and North East downtown to see which area have less competition (i.e. serving desserts)\n",
